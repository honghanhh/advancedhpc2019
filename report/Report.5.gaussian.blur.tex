\section{Explain how you implement the Gaussian Blur filter?}\\
\noindent
For Gaussian Blur Convolution, I tried to implement with CPU, GPU without shared memory, and GPU with shared memory.
Without shared memory, each thread stores its own kernel array. Meanwhile, when using shared memory, all threads in a block using one shared kernel array.\\
\noindent
The results for block size of (32,32):
\begin{verbatim}
Labwork 5 CPU ellapsed 169.1ms
Labwork 5 GPU with shared memory ellapsed 6.2ms
Labwork 5 GPU without shared memory ellapsed 10.1ms
GPU without shared memory is faster than CPU: 16.78 times
GPU with shared memory is faster than CPU: 27.49 times
GPU with shared memory is faster than GPU without shared memory: 1.64 times
\end{verbatim}
    
\section{Try experimenting with different 2D block size values?}\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Block size of (64 , 64)
\begin{verbatim}
Labwork 5 CPU ellapsed 156.9ms
Labwork 5 GPU with shared memory ellapsed 14.2ms
Labwork 5 GPU without shared memory ellapsed 13.1ms
GPU without shared memory is faster than CPU: 11.93 times
GPU with shared memory is faster than CPU: 11.05 times
GPU with shared memory is faster than GPU without shared memory: 0.93 times            
\end{verbatim}

\item Block size of (128 , 128)
\begin{verbatim}
Labwork 5 CPU ellapsed 159.9ms
Labwork 5 GPU with shared memory ellapsed 9.9ms
Labwork 5 GPU without shared memory ellapsed 13.4ms
GPU without shared memory is faster than CPU: 11.96 times
GPU with shared memory is faster than CPU: 16.13 times
GPU with shared memory is faster than GPU without shared memory: 1.35 times
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
